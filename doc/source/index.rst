   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the documentation for the Datarray prototype
=======================================================

Datarray is a prototype implementation of a numpy ndarray subclass with named
axes and optionally labeled ticks on said axes.

For now the code lives at:

http://github.com/fperez/datarray

and the documentation is being pushed to:

http://fperez.org/py4science/datarray

This is to avoid using GitHub's page-hosting system which requires the
pollution of the main code repository.  Eventually we expect this code to find
a more permanent home within numpy itself.
